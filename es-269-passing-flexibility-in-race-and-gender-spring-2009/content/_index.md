This course is primarily a literature seminar. We will use American literature as a lens through which to examine different passing tropes. It will provide an introduction to queer, gender, and critical race theories for science and math majors. We will read such works as _Running A Thousand Miles for Freedom_, _Incognegro_, and Focault's _A History of Sexuality_, to name just a few.
